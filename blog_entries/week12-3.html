<h1> Almost done - Search feature is now live – Time to upload my webpages</h1>
<p>
    Hurray! Search functionality is now up. I have used <b>MyAPIFILMS API</b>.
    Search is based on movie names which results an array of movie posters along with the movie almost matching movie titles.

    I couldn’t upload any web pages so far in the past four days only because of the search feature.

    Because, I have planned to use search functionality in every page and uploading my webpages
    without completing this feature would result in an incomplete webpage. Now that I am done with search feature, I will upload them today!
