    <h3> Week5 : Experiments on Jquery </h3> </p>
     
    <p> During last week, I have started learning jquery and worked on some experiments such as <b> how to hide and show html elements </b>
        ,<b> how to implement fade and toggle elements</b> and <b> how to create custom animations </b>
    </p>

    <p> Coming to this week, I have learned few more Jquery effects, </p> 
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b> Sortable and Draggable elements :</b>
                <p> By using draggable functionality on any DOM element, we can drag the DOM element from one position to another.
                    Here, the elements are sorted by themselves as we have written sorted functionality too.

                    <pre>
                            $(function () {
                                console.log("inside script");
                                $("ul").sortable();
                                $("ul").draggable();
                            });       
                    </pre>
            
                    <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/vikasv/experiments/jquery2/sortable.html" target="_blank"> Open this page and try 
                    dragging object by clicking on it with the mouse and dragging it anywhere within the viewport and 
                    we can see that DOM is dragged and other elements are sorted .</a>
                    </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b> Image animation using Jumbotron</b>
                <p> A jumbotron indicates a big box for calling extra attention to some special content or information.
                    A jumbotron is displayed as a grey box with rounded corners. It also enlarges the font sizes of the text inside it.
                    Use a 'div' element with class .jumbotron to create a jumbotron. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, I have used effects on x-axis inorder to move the banner from right to left
                </p>
                <pre>
                      banner.css('backgroundPosition', x + 'px' + ' ' + y + 'px');
                      window.setInterval(function () {
                            banner.css("backgroundPosition", x + 'px' + ' ' + y + 'px');
                            x--;
                      }, 90); 
                </pre>

                <b> Working with Maps</b>
                <p> In this experiment, I have worked on google maps i.e by embedding google maps using javascript</p>
                <p> I have written various javascripts to locate the current location and any other location needed</p>
                <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/vikasv/experiments/jquery2/geo.html"> Google Maps</a>
