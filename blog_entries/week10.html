    <h3> Week10 : Project progress </h3>

    The past two weeks has been busy working with my project which is Fitness center website. So far, one of the major features I have
    developed is that generating video suggestions using YouTube API. In this, the user on my website can choose from one of the categories
    related to fitness and get suggestions. This helps an user to train himself rather than having a personal trainer. The suggestion
    features are purely based on the search results for the keywords given by me but I would like to make the results more relevant 
    and useful using much more complex algorithms available. 

    In the coming weeks, I am planning to implement a Nutrition API which suggests the nutritious diet that is required to be taken
    by an user during his training phase. Also, I have plans to handle Amazon API so that they can search and buy the necessary fitness
    related equipment right from website. 

    Overall, I would like my website to be in such a way that, it stands as an onestop website for the trainers and trainees related to fitness.
    I have partially completed my home page so far and looking forward to make it much more appealing and attractive. Here is the link
    for my home page <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/vikasv/project/homepage.aspx"> Homepage link </a> . i have almost completed using youtube api to fetch the search results from youtube and display on my website.
   here is the link for getting video suggestions from my website <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/vikasv/project/fitnessvideos.aspx"> Fitness video suggestions link </a> .
