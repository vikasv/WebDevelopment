<h1>A major setback! Change in project!! </h1>

<p> My ongoing project is Fitness club website on which I have been working for almost ten days. I have planned to use below APIs: </p>
 <ul>
    <li> <b>Yummly API</b> to suggest recipes based on the ingredients and their quantity used while cooking.</li>
    <li> <b>Nutrinitionix API</b> to show case food diet depending upon the intake of calaries.  </li>
    <li> <b>Youtube Restful API</b> to showcase the videos based on search categories. </li>
    <li> <b>Amazon API</b> to display fitness related equipments available in the market. </li>
</ul>
<p>
    I have requested for the developer access for all the APIs as soon as I have finalized upon them and started working on the project. I have developed the video search functionality using Youtube API and developed a nice and appealing webpage where the video suggestions are fetched using the Youtube API based on the search terms used by the user.
    I have started working on Amazon API where I was almost able to handle Amazon API and fetch the required data from it. One week through the project and I have not received the access for the Yummly and Nutritionix APIs. Since it was too late to get access for new APIs, I have request Professor to change my project to my back up plan which I always interested in doing, i.e., movie website.
</p>
<p>
    Even though I was disappointed to not being able to continue with my project because of the access issues after spending so much time on it, I was in a tight situation to take a tough call and I took it, to change the project and build a new website from the scratch.
