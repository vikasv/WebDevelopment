<h1>Bounce back time!! – A new project (Movie website) </h1>
<h4>Thanks to professor for understanding my situation and supporting my decision to change my project even though there is only 4 more days to go for the final day. Fortunately, professor has also allowed me to use bootstrap because of lack of time.  So, it is my time to bounce back from my situation to build my new website from the scratch. </h4>

<p> One good thing was I had the developer access I will require for the new project. I have dedicated all my time for the new project working more than 12 hours per day.
Coming to the new project, it is about a movies website which showcases Movie news, movie in theatres currently, upcoming movie news and details, movies based on top collections and also provides a search functionality where one can search for the information based on a movie name and also view trailers based on genres.
This is the whole idea of the project and it’s high time I get my hands dirty on the project. </p>
