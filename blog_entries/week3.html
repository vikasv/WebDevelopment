    <h3> Week2 : HTML basics</h3>

    During the second week of course, I have started working on basic HTML tags and HTML forms. As, I am completely new to html before this, 
    it helped me a lot to know how things actually work on the web pages.
    I had worked on responsiveness of the pages. I had made some changes on my home page to make it look more appealing.
    Next week, I was ready to work on CSS.

    The experiments which I have worked on are listed below :
