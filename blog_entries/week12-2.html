<h1> Fetching movies statistics </h1>
<p> Here, I am using RottenTomatoes API. I have implemented 4 features based on the data I fetch from the API. They are: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Display movie currently in theatres which includes a lot of information about each movie, say, date of release, synopsis of the movie, cast, length, etc. </li>
    <li> Showcase highest grossing movies at the Box Office so far in the descending order. </li>
    <li> Clicking on the movie poster takes you to IMDB page if one would like to see the ratings and reviews of the movie. </li>
    <li>Movies releasing this weekend </li>
    <li>Future releases </li>
</ul>
<p>Every detail is sent as an AJAX request and received as JSONP response through <b> Rotten Tomatoes API </b>. </p>
