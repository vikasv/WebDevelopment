<h1>Spring break!! Hurrayyyy </h1>

This was a week of holidays for Spring break. During this time, there wasn't much work done on experiments and exploring new stuff but 
<b>most of my time was spent on fixing bugs in the previous blogs and experiments  suggested by TA and also the other bugs which I found myself. </b>
