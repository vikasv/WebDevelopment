    <h3> Week1 : Startup </h3>
    During first week of course, I have completed the requirements for startup which includes the following :
    <ol>
        <li>
            Installing visual studio
        </li>
        <li>
            Downloading the essential files
        </li>
        <li>
            Setup file transfer
        </li>
        <li>
            Created a home page which included my photo and description.
        </li>
    </ol>

    After that, I was excited to work on various topics. I started my first week experiments with HTML.
