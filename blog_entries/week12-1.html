<h1>Home Page Implementation</h1>

<p>The website name is MovieHub. The home page welcomes the user with an attractive slide show of movie posters of the latest and upcoming movies. 
    It also provides an overview of all the information available on the website on the left half of the page and also 
    latest movie news and gossips on the right half of it using RSS feeds.
A search functionality is also available (which is not yet implemented) on all the pages of the website.
     Overall, I wanted to keep my project small, simple and yet attractive.
