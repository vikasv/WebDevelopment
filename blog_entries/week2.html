    <h3> Week3 : CSS </h3>

    <p>
    
        During the third week of the course, my experiments were around exploring CSS and CSS3. Having fundamentals of HTML
        will get you started on making a web page. But the default styling of components on the web page is pretty basic and 
        CSS i.e, Styling sheet is must to add the aesthetic feel to your web page. Hence, I have started learning CSS and CSS3 
        to make my blog much more appealing and attractive. 

        Learning CSS takes opens a new window to the world of Web Designing and there is a lot more you can do on top of a HTML page.
        I was amazed to see the difference brought by adding CSS to my page and its a great experience playing around with CSS.
        I have listed below the experiments I have done during the week:

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                    <b>Hover effect: </b> We generally click on a button or link to perform an action. But there are some actions
                that could be done before actually clicking around. Those can be performed using Hover effect.  
                <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/vikasv/experiments/css/css-1.html"> Image hovering </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <b>Border-image property: </b> Any data or a component like label or a table can have a border as lines or dotted lines.
                But to have an image as a border for a text, we use border-image property to achieve this. 
                
                Sample code: <br>
<pre>                #border
                        {
                            border-image: url(border.png) 20 20 round;
                        }       
</pre>
                <br>
                <b>Rotation effect:  </b> We can have a paragraph or any component inside a "div" and have the "div" rotated at a given
                angle. 
                <pre>
                Sample code: <br>
                    twoD
                    {
                        margin:20px;
                        padding-top:20px;
                        height:200px;
                        width:100px;
                        background-color:red;
                       <b> transform:rotate(40deg);</b>
                    }
                </pre>
                <br>
                <b>Rotate when clicked:  </b> CSS3 allows features like rotating a "div" when clicked. Before CSS3, it was done using JavaScript
                but now there is no need of that. CSS3 have many more exhaustive features like this and provides a thrilling        experience
                while exploring number of amazing tricks and hacks.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Fixed background image:</b><br>
                In this page, the background image is fixed by using fixed property and also used hover effect.
                <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/vikasv/experiments/css/css-3.html"> Fixed background </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Email Id validation: </b>
                I have also experimented on validating an email address using bootstrap.

</ol>
