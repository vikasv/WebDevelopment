        <p> From the same manufacturer as the legendary F1, the P1 might just live up the insane legacy of the first 230 mph production car.

Lurking underneath the carbon fiber is a 3.8 liter twin-turbo V8 which when paired with the onboard electric motor is good for 903 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of torque. The right way to think about this isn�t even as a hybrid, but like a roadgoing Formula 1 car with a Kinetic Energy Recovery System. This will help you get over the fact that you can only get 9 miles on the battery.

Straight ahead speed isn�t quite as lunatic as it was on the F1, with the top speed limited to a measly 217 mph. But it will get you to 60 mph in less than 3 seconds, and make it from 0-182 in 16.5 seconds, twice as fast as Ferrari 458 Italia. It will  also grip and brake like the amazing Spiderman on PEDs.

McLaren has gone all out on the quality control, when engineers test the waterproof seals the car  is doused in nearly 4,000 gallons of water.

If you want one, act now because they just went into production and most of the 375 are spoken for. </p>

        <p> The engineers over at Hennessey may need a little less testosterone and a little more Thorazine. That hasn�t stopped them, though, from achieving something that most physicists consider impossible. This little company has produced the fastest ever production car, capable of 271 mph.

They say everything is bigger in Texas and the Lone Star State-based tuning house is happy to that statement correct.

The Venom GT is filled with enough horsepower to stretch across the Lone Star State itself, packing a mind-blowing 1,500 horsepower mined from a poisonous 7.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine. 0-60 is pegged at two seconds. The riotous acceleration doesn�t end there, though, the Venom claims a top speed of 287 mph.

If the CERN particle accelerator keeps having trouble they might just think about driving a Venom GT around it instead. Or maybe NASA could use it for deep space travel.

At just $1.1 million this car is almost a bargain considering it can out strip everything on this list, except maybe: the mighty Koenigsegg One:1.</p>

        <p> Denmark may only be known for its massive butter consumption and as the setting of Hamlet. But the Zenovo ST1 is definitely �to be.�

Well, only three of them will actually �be.� Apparently because they need to be hand carved from adamantium and Thor�s hammer.

The results though are impressive, the ST1 is propelled by a turbo supercharged 7.0-liter V8, which might have been nicked off of a P-38 Lightning. This monster powerplant is good for a top speed of 233 mph and a 0-60 time south of three seconds.

Unfortunately for the mighty Dane, its initial exhibitions have not gone well. It nearly killed Jeremy Clarkson of Top Gear by setting him on fire and then didn�t even go that fast.

No wonder it looks so angry. Don�t count the ST1 out yet though, because Zenvo is hard at work. </p>
